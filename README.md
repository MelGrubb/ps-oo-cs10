# Object-oriented Design with C# 10

This repository contains the demo assets for the Pluralsight course "Object-oriented Design with C# 10".

Each module has a pair of corresponding markdown file in the root folder containing the design notes and diagrams for that module.

## Branches

Branches exist for the beginning and ending point of each module, except for Module 1, which is the course overview. Clone the repository and switch to the appropriate starting branch for each module if you want to follow along, or check out the "-end" branch to see the final state of the project at the end of that module.
